# Bobsled-Launcher-Code
This repository can be used to continuously update our program to power the motor; in addition flow charts and any other details pertaining to the code can be placed here.

We will have several sets of code depending on two variables -- the coding language and motor selection. Our two microcontrollers are Arduino and Pyboard that we can try at first. 
Prior to starting the code, we will establish a flow chart indicating the intended process.
